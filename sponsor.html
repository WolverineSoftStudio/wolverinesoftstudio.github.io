          <h>Our Mission</h>
          <p>To sustain and foster the game development community on campus by providing students of all backgrounds with hands-on, multidisciplinary experience in game design, feature implementation, asset creation, and production.</p>

            At the start of 2020, WolverineSoft Studio will not even be a year old, yet its membership has
            grown exponentially. In this critical period of growth for our student organization and the
            Michigan games industry, there are a multitude of meaningful ways that you can contribute to
            our continued success and expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because we are a certified 501(c)(3) and a rapidly growing
            group of young adults about to enter the industry, there are also many ways that we, in turn, can
            return your generosity.  Our student leaders would be happy to organize events in collaboration
            with your company and discuss any other courses of action.

          <h>The Process</h>
          <p>Once payment is received by the university (credit card or check),
            it is entered into the system, processed to provide you with the
            tax deduction paperwork, and then sent to our SOAS (school
            finance) account. This process can take around 2 to 3 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to speed up the process, we request that you clearly
